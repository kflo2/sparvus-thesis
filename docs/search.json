They resemble earthworms and occur in in tropical areas of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Also called caecilians, some species are oviparous  [producing eggs which are hatched after they have been laid by the parent, as in birds] and some are viviparous [give live birth]. Most species have aquatic juvenile forms, but some larvae are terrestrial. Members of this order are rarely used in the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnura\n\n\n\nAccording to Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) (2025), Anurans are the frogs and toads, and at more than 3,400 species they account for the bulk of amphibian species. These tailless amphibians usually have long hindlimbs that are adapted for jumping. The eggs are usually laid in water, although some are carried by the adult, and the larvae are aquatic. Adults may be terrestrial or aquatic. Commonly used laboratory genera include:\n\nBufo (Anaxyrus) (the true toads), which have thick, warty skin and well-developed parotoid glands.\nRana (Lithobates) (bullfrogs and leopard frogs) are semi-aquatic with smooth skin and are best known for their use in teaching anatomy and studies of physiology.\nDendrobates and Oophaga (poison dart or arrow frogs), which are brightly colored, arboreal frogs that produce cutaneous toxins that are used by aboriginal peoples and studied by scientists.\nXenopus (African clawed frogs), which are primitive, aquatic frogs used as a source of oocytes for developmental and genetic studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaudata\n\n\n\nAccording to Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) (2025), the order Caudata (formerly classified as Urodela and still sometimes referred to as urodeles) includes three general groups: sirens, “primitive” salamanders, and “advanced” salamanders. Sirens are completely aquatic, lack hindlimbs, and have external gills. Salamanders are long-tailed amphibians that usually have two pairs of limbs of approximately equal size. Some are totally aquatic and some are terrestrial as adults. Some species (such as the axolotl) exhibit “neoteny” or the persistence of larval characteristics into adulthood. Fertilization is internal except in sirens and Cryptobranchidae (a group of primitive salamanders). Eggs are usually deposited singly or in clumps or strings in water and hatch into aquatic larvae, though some salamanders have direct development of terrestrial eggs.",

Water generally does not need to be aerated, with the possible exception of water housing larval forms or gill-breathing adults. The pH of water (and other environmental elements for terrestrial species) is best kept in the neutral or slightly alkaline range (7-8.5). A very acidic environment (less than 4.0) is likely to be toxic. Water in static systems should be changed after feeding to remove uneaten food and minimize the bacterial load in the water.\nVentilation\nAir flow rates recommended for mammals (15-20 changes per hour) are likely to be dehydrating in terrestrial amphibians. Ambient humidity for these animals should be maintained at 70-80 percent to help animals maintain skin moisture. Ventilation rates should be decreased from mammalian standards and/or air should be humidified for amphibians.\nSanitation Sanitation of amphibian enclosures can pose special challenges because of territorial behavior and pheromone marking as well as the sensitivity of amphibians to chemical agents.\nFrequent sanitation of terrestrial species can disrupt territorial markings and lead to behavioral distress. On the other hand, ignoring sanitation can lead to accumulation of toxic metabolites and opportunistic bacteria. A balance must be found between the competing goals of a clean environment and minimizing disruption of the animal’s normal behaviors. Singly housed amphibians in terraria may be managed effectively by cleaning cages approximately every two weeks. Amphibians in an aquatic environment require cleaning more frequently, at intervals ranging from daily to weekly. Tanks for housing Xenopus species are commonly cleaned after feeding, approximately three times weekly.\nSanitization should be accomplished without using the chemicals normally employed with mammals (for example, detergents and quaternary ammonium or phenolic compounds). If the cages will tolerate it, standard cagewashers without chemicals are effective. Physical scrubbing accompanied by copious flushing with clean, non-chlorinated water may be effective. If a disinfectant must be used, dilute bleach (for example, 1:32 ratio with water) may be used if it is thoroughly rinsed after use.\nNutrition Adult amphibians are carnivorous and most require moving (live) food, although some of the more commonly used laboratory species such as Xenopus and Ambystoma do well on chopped heart muscle, liver, or commercial fish diets or frog diets.\nLive foods may include crickets, mealworms, tubifex worms, fly larvae, earthworms, and “pinkies” (immature rodents). Crickets and other arthropods are usually deficient in calcium and vitamins. This may be supplemented by dusting the insects with a calcium/vitamin mix, or by raising the feed insects in-house and feeding them with diets enhanced with calcium and vitamins.\nLarval amphibians are mainly herbivorous or omnivorous, becoming carnivorous as they undergo metamorphosis. They feed on copepods and other microscopic invertebrates, or flake-type fish food, alfalfa pellets, or boiled spinach."
