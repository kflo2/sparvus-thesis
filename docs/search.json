They resemble earthworms and occur in in tropical areas of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Also called caecilians, some species are oviparous  [producing eggs which are hatched after they have been laid by the parent, as in birds] and some are viviparous [give live birth]. Most species have aquatic juvenile forms, but some larvae are terrestrial. Members of this order are rarely used in the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnura\n\n\n\nAccording to Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) (2025), Anurans are the frogs and toads, and at more than 3,400 species they account for the bulk of amphibian species. These tailless amphibians usually have long hindlimbs that are adapted for jumping. The eggs are usually laid in water, although some are carried by the adult, and the larvae are aquatic. Adults may be terrestrial or aquatic. Commonly used laboratory genera include:\n\nBufo (Anaxyrus) (the true toads), which have thick, warty skin and well-developed parotoid glands.\nRana (Lithobates) (bullfrogs and leopard frogs) are semi-aquatic with smooth skin and are best known for their use in teaching anatomy and studies of physiology.\nDendrobates and Oophaga (poison dart or arrow frogs), which are brightly colored, arboreal frogs that produce cutaneous toxins that are used by aboriginal peoples and studied by scientists.\nXenopus (African clawed frogs), which are primitive, aquatic frogs used as a source of oocytes for developmental and genetic studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaudata\n\n\n\nAccording to Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) (2025), the order Caudata (formerly classified as Urodela and still sometimes referred to as urodeles) includes three general groups: sirens, “primitive” salamanders, and “advanced” salamanders. Sirens are completely aquatic, lack hindlimbs, and have external gills. Salamanders are long-tailed amphibians that usually have two pairs of limbs of approximately equal size. Some are totally aquatic and some are terrestrial as adults. Some species (such as the axolotl) exhibit “neoteny” or the persistence of larval characteristics into adulthood. Fertilization is internal except in sirens and Cryptobranchidae (a group of primitive salamanders). Eggs are usually deposited singly or in clumps or strings in water and hatch into aquatic larvae, though some salamanders have direct development of terrestrial eggs.",
